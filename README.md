# SimpleViz

This code allows you to easily create box/violin/dot plots, volcano plots, PCA plots and heatmap using R Shinyapp. Since it is designed to run on a Shinyapp server, you will need to separately install the required packages using install.R if you wish to run it locally. Once the required packages are installed, you can run app.R in RStudio and start the server by running the app.
